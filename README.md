I've been working on a GUI design for a web-based Security Service Management System that aims to streamline the management of security officers, client interactions, bookings, inventory, and more.
My design focuses on user-friendly navigation, intuitive interfaces, and a professional aesthetic to enhance the user experience.

Key Features:
User Management
Employee and Client Management
Inventory Management
Booking and Payment Systems
Operations and Training Management
Check out the design and let me know your thoughts! ðŸŽ¨
